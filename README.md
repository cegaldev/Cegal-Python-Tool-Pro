# Cegal-Python-Tool-Pro
Cegal Python Tool Pro enables you to connect into an active Petrel project from any external Python IDE. It allows to expose your Petrel data to the full data science life cycle. Domain objects can be retrieved from Petrel, manipulated in Python, visualized in Jupyter notebooks and then streamed back to Petrel.
